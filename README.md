This dashboard provides a centralized hub where users can:

- **Connect to multiple services** - Link any website or service accounts
- **Secure auto-login** - Store credentials once and automatically log in to services
- **One-click access** - Click a button to instantly access connected services
- **Beautiful interface** - Modern glass morphism design with smooth animations

## How it works

Instead of visiting multiple websites and logging in separately, users can:

1. Set up their credentials once in the dashboard
2. Access any connected service with a single click
3. Never worry about remembering passwords again

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
